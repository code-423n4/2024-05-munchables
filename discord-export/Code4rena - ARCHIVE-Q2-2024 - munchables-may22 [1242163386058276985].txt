if only the lockmanager is in scope, does the functions of the inherited contracts are in scope too in any circumstance ?  i ask in general not only for this contest


[05/22/2024 20:39] 0xinsanity
We're only interested in the LockManager contract, you can assume the inherited contracts work as intended

@0xinsanity 
Are bugs resulting from token behaviors for tokens outside USDB & WETH in scope?


[05/22/2024 21:47] 0xinsanity
No


[05/23/2024 02:15] petro_1912
are tokens that has high decimals( > 18) supported ?


[05/23/2024 02:22] dontonka
this has been deployed on Blast testnet (https://sepolia.blast.io) ?


[05/23/2024 02:32] comradektg
Hi @0xinsanity, command 'pnpm build' failed with this error "Contract name "IAirnodeRrpV0" must be unique.", any idea why?


[05/23/2024 02:34] 0xinsanity
no


[05/23/2024 02:34] 0xinsanity
we have some testnet versions that are deployed but its not necessarily true that they are the most up-to-date. you should deploy versions yourself for the latest contract instanaces

you should be running `pnpm run generate`


[05/23/2024 02:40] 0xinsanity

[05/23/2024 02:40] 0xinsanity
have you run build?


[05/23/2024 02:40] 0xinsanity
`pnpm run build`?


[05/23/2024 02:41] 0xinsanity
its possible your foundry submodules arent installed


[05/23/2024 02:42] comradektg
@0xinsanity Yes I did, in your package.json config, the command "pnpm run build" will run "pnpm wagmi generate" and it failed with 'Contract name "IAirnodeRrpV0" must be unique.'

@0xinsanity any issues regarding tokens are in scope or not? coz in docs its clearly mentioned they are but your above message says only USDB and WETH tokens are in scope

@0xinsanity hi! What are the benefits of longer lock times?


[05/23/2024 12:21] 0xinsanity
in the context of the broader system. it gives you more bonuses


[05/23/2024 12:21] 0xinsanity
but not relevant for this audit

thankyou 

[05/23/2024 12:51] dontonka
users with Role.PriceFeed_X role I assume are trusted ?


[05/23/2024 12:54] 0xinsanity

[05/23/2024 13:06] snake_eaterr148
Any tips on how to deploy this locally to experiment with it?


[05/23/2024 13:06] 0xinsanity
Should be fairly simple as long as your env is setup properly


[05/23/2024 13:07] 0xinsanity
should be able to just run `pnpm run deploy`


[05/23/2024 13:08] snake_eaterr148
what exactly would I be deploying to. Locally I mean


[05/23/2024 13:09] 0xinsanity
you should create a local anvil clone with fork-url specified to a blast sepolia rpc


[05/23/2024 13:09] snake_eaterr148

[05/23/2024 13:27] thecoderfresk
Does tokens with less than 18 decimals supported ?


[05/23/2024 13:57] 0xinsanity
it should work with tokens less than 18 decimals


[05/23/2024 16:06] snake_eaterr148
Does the deploy script deploy ERC20 contracts too? i.e. usdb and weth


[05/23/2024 16:11] snake_eaterr148
Yeah it does


[05/23/2024 16:14] 0xinsanity
there are test tokens for some of our unit tests but they dont deploy the usdb and weth tokens


[05/23/2024 16:14] 0xinsanity
they are assigned

Does anyone know how to do debugging with console.log directly in contract? When importing `forge-std/console.sol` and running `pnpm tests` it does not output to console


[05/23/2024 21:19] 0xinsanity
the javascript code doesn’t support that, i advise replicating the functionality of the test into foundry or using other means to debug

Is the `startReveal()` function that users call to reveal Munchables gained from locking tokens in the `NFTOverlord` contract?


[05/23/2024 22:59] mctoady
You can still run ‘foundry test’ once you’ve built with pnpm and you’ll get the logs


[05/23/2024 23:47] 0xinsanity
yes but irrelevant for this audit


[05/24/2024 00:02] th3l1ghtd3m0n

[05/24/2024 00:12] yotov721
Is it known who will judge the contest or is it revealed once it is over ?


[05/24/2024 00:16] yotov721
Asking because there is some info in the READme and the sponsor says the reverse. Not sure if it will be a valid submission 🤔

Hi
what is the source of the price from which price feed roles obtain their data?


[05/24/2024 12:53] 0xinsanity
assume trusted sources

[05/24/2024 16:48] snake_eaterr148
what is meant by this, taken from the main invariants sections:
"Assume it's intentional that setLockDuration resets all of the existing lock token durations."


[05/24/2024 17:08] avoloder
It means that the duration set with the *#setLockDuration* owerwrites the lock duration of every token that you locked with *#lock* function


[05/24/2024 17:43] th3l1ghtd3m0n
What is the maximum lock duration?


[05/24/2024 17:47] unique0x0
90 days


[05/24/2024 17:50] avoloder
Can someone please explain what the Lockdrop is actually for? Is this the period in which you are able to lock your tokens?


[05/24/2024 18:05] 0xinsanity
no


[05/24/2024 18:05] 0xinsanity
you can lock your tokens at any point


[05/24/2024 18:06] 0xinsanity
the lockdrop period is specifically for nft reveals and to set minimum and maximum lock times


[05/24/2024 18:06] 0xinsanity
to clarify, people should still be able to lock at any point regardless if there is a lockdrop event

can you send the code you are referring to


[05/25/2024 03:20] dontonka
it's simply an array of address (address[] calldata _contracts). 🤔


[05/25/2024 03:40] 0xinsanity
it’s the token contracts that the price update applies to

[05/25/2024 13:40] 0xinsanity
yes


[05/25/2024 15:55] avoloder
@0xinsanity  What do users get if they lock their tokens outside of the lockdrop period (since they don't get NFTs outside the Lockdrop period)?


[05/25/2024 15:56] maushish
nothing just normal schnibbles


[05/25/2024 15:58] avoloder
Ok, but should the minLockDuration always be respected or is this only relevant for NFTs?


[05/25/2024 16:02] sancybars
The NFTs are the munchables? And the schinbbles are used to fed them, if the player don't get NFT what will the schinbbles be used for?


[05/25/2024 16:04] maushish
acc to 0xinsanity `the lockdrop period is specifically for nft reveals and to set minimum and maximum lock times ` i suppose its only relevant for NFTs


[05/25/2024 16:11] maushish
they will be harvested like normally


[05/25/2024 16:11] maushish
i might be wrong here @0xinsanity  let me know

@0xinsanity what's the reason behind going with the PriceFeed role and proposals way of determining an asset's USD value instead of using an oracle or other alternatives? 🤔

Does someone tried to write some Echidna tests?

I tried this:

```
pragma solidity 0.8.25;

import "./LockManager.sol";
import "./ILockManager.sol";
import "./BaseConfigStorage.sol";


contract EchidnaSolution {

    LockManager lockManager;

    ILockManager.Lockdrop public lockdrop;
    constructor(address _configStorage) {
        lockManager = new LockManager(_configStorage);
    }

    function testConfigureLockdrop(
        ILockManager.Lockdrop calldata _lockdropData
    ) public {

        require(_lockdropData.end < block.timestamp);

        require(_lockdropData.start >= _lockdropData.end);

        try lockManager.configureLockdrop(_lockdropData) {
            // Post-condition
            assert(_lockdropData.start == lockdrop.start);
            assert(_lockdropData.end == lockdrop.end);
            assert(_lockdropData.minLockDuration == lockdrop.minLockDuration);
        } catch (bytes memory err) {
            // Post-condition
            assert(false);
        }
    }
}

```


But it is not successful:

```
ethsec@e934c081ac1f:/home/training/src/echidna$ echidna echidna_tests.sol --config config.yaml 
Warning: unused option: contracts

Someone to help?


[05/26/2024 06:38] donkicha
Any ideas how to run it successfully are very appreciate!


[05/26/2024 08:24] yotov721
It says 
> echidna: No bytecode found for contract "/home/training/src/echidna/BaseBlastManager.sol:BaseBlastManager"
I haven't used echidna, but have you build the project contracts and are they in the directory specified in the error ?


[05/26/2024 09:11] donkicha
I am also learning Echidna. I am not sure the contracts are built. 

Actually, in the workshop that I am following there is no such thing like building the contracts, before running Echidna....


[05/26/2024 09:12] donkicha
And also, I moved all of the files in the directory `echidna`, because otherwise the imports caused an errors.


[05/26/2024 11:37] paprikrumplikas
Will there be additional audit rounds with the other contracts of the protocol in scope?


[05/26/2024 12:11] donkicha

[05/26/2024 12:16] 0xinsanity
the price feed isn’t essential to the protocol, it just needs to be updated weekly or biweekly or so.

we’ll  consider it for future contracts we create depending on how well this one goes 🙂

Could you look at my inquiry in the private thread?

answered


[05/27/2024 12:59] 0xinsanity
Hey guys, getting a lot of questions about whether we support tokens of >18 decimals. i think that was a mistake when filling the form, we have no intention of supporting tokens >18 decimals


[05/27/2024 13:14] aslanbekaibimov
@0xinsanity what about rebasing and fee on transfer tokens? Do you intend to support them, or was it a mistake as well?

**🚨 AUDIT ALERT**

@🐺Wardens The **Munchables **audit is now closed! Huge thanks to everyone who participated 🔍, whether you submitted a finding or not.

What's next: The sponsor team and judge will review the findings over the next couple of weeks. Feel free to ping a Civics-Admin if you have questions along the way!


[05/27/2024 20:14] yiamat
How many findings submitted?


[05/27/2024 20:14] volokinn
findings repo is not yet ready


[05/27/2024 20:34] volokinn
575


[05/27/2024 20:38] yotov721
I see 77


[05/27/2024 20:42] rouhsamad
How many submissions finaly?


[05/27/2024 20:48] yotov721
575 in validation repo and 77 in finding repo. Take in mind that there is no issue that is in both repos so 575 + 77 = **652**


[05/27/2024 21:10] rouhsamad
what is the different between this two repos? is this a new thing?


[05/27/2024 21:11] rouhsamad
i dont have backstage role, so i can't see


[05/27/2024 21:15] dontonka
652 is the gran total. Not all will make it to the findings repo, they must be deemed sufficiently quality by the Validator to make it there.


[05/27/2024 21:27] yotov721
I think so. It's from the new update that adds Validators to judging


[05/27/2024 21:50] rouhsamad
Interesting


[05/27/2024 22:08] dontonka
yes this is brand new from few contests now.

{Reactions}
👍 

[05/28/2024 00:13] maushish
So its my first contest it would be great if someone can answer these specific questions:
- How does judging works after the contest
- whats the procedure to tackle judge on some issue (ex- severity was lowered)


[05/28/2024 02:28] xterminate69
-A judge basically judges what the scouts have deemed legit/appropriate and then lowers or upgrades a report based on what he thinks.  
- Give an extra PoC or an extra explanation and maybe it will be upgraded.


[05/28/2024 03:09] maushish
So is there a way where I can see my finding's current status?
Like a GitHub repo with all the issues


[05/28/2024 03:10] maushish
If not then how will I know that judges want me to submit a POC for particular finding?


[05/28/2024 07:17] prapandey031
For this, you would need the SR role

How long does it usually take for the results to get published


[05/28/2024 13:58] dontonka
depends on contest, but 2-4 weeks is the norm (depending on how many findings etc) I think, but can go longer


[05/28/2024 16:55] xterminate69
Zksync was 3 months


[05/28/2024 16:57] snake_eaterr148
Munchables scope was s single source file, so I imagine it won't take that long


[05/28/2024 17:02] xterminate69
2 weeks minimum i would say


[05/28/2024 17:02] dontonka
yes. that was the highest pot in C4 history and a lot of submissions, so the most complex one. that would be the worst case scenario, but that's extreme and not the norm. I think 2-5 weeks is a good range usually, again depending on the pot size, submission, complexity, etc


[05/28/2024 17:04] xterminate69
The problem is that there a lot of invalid reports on these small projects.


[05/28/2024 17:04] xterminate69
most of the time


[05/28/2024 17:04] dontonka
yes i know, that is annoying, for everyone, judge, warden that want their payout fast etc.


[05/28/2024 17:05] dontonka
if i compare with Arbiturm, much longer contest, and not even 400 submission. much complex one too in term of code base.


[05/28/2024 17:05] xterminate69
I mean there are some reports that dont even have an explanation but some wich are more comlex and require good understnding these are the ones that slow projects down


[05/28/2024 17:06] xterminate69
i dont get people that submit an unexplained report


[05/28/2024 17:06] snake_eaterr148
Earlier in the messages some people said there are 77 submissions in findings repo, and 575 in validation repo. What is validation repo?


[05/28/2024 17:06] dontonka
we all started somewhere, there is a learning curve for new warden that is a burden on everyone else 😄

{Reactions}
🫡 

[05/28/2024 17:08] xterminate69
Agreed but not submitting false reports, i found a lot of invalid reports in sherlock but when someone is a noob or someone is lazy that is pretty understandable.


[05/28/2024 17:11] dontonka
> Agreed but not submitting false reports
It's not always in bad faith, sometimes the warden really believe in his claim, but without providing a coded PoC he fools himself and might even fool the judge.


[05/28/2024 17:13] dontonka
Platforms are not all the same either, for example on Cantina I think the level of SR is a little higher (since not everyone can join, you need an invite) and accuracy increase overall, so let's spam overall.


[05/29/2024 02:30] xterminate69

Sum of all rewards should be 20,000$ right?


[06/12/2024 23:30] itsmetechjay
The HM + QA awards would equal $16,600. The full breakdown of the award pool is in the [audit repo](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-munchables?tab=readme-ov-file#munchables-audit-details).

Yes this is something you need to be aware, not all platform has the same behavior in this regards. In C4, the pot announced `is never` the pot that will go to wardens, as Judge/Validator etc are deducted from there. As opposed to Cantina as for example, the pot announced is what wardens get. I don't know other platform. It's a matter of knowing this detail properly.

I think they clearly state what are the awards for wardens’ H/M 🤨

@Jay | C4 , Hi, I know that it's not possible to do anything after audit is already done, but I'm just curious is there any ability for me to check my invalid reports? because I've just double checked my notes in code and I found out that I actually wrote a report for a bug that was marked as HIGH in final report, but my report was rejected (I know that screenshot won't prove anything :), but my goal is to check what did I do wrong in report writing just to make sure not to make this mistake in the future

Don't see any for some reason

You didn't find your username in data file ?

Also a similar question, I have reported an issue as low-risk but it turned out to be a medium and my finding was invalidated. Does it happen like this usually when you misjudge your finding or it was just an unlucky turn of events?


[06/24/2024 19:17] yasminee.
I think your report was invalidated, but it doesn't relate to the severity. You can ask here #❓・questions  for a more suitable response
